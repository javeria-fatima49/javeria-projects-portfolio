    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Javeria Fatima, currently in my second year at Government Degree
    College Nazimabad. </p>
    <p>I am passionate about technology and am currently taking
    an artificial intelligence course through the Government of Sindh
    initiative.</p>
    <p> This course has allowed me to delve into the fascinating world
    of AI and develop my skills in this cutting-edge field.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey in technology started early, and I have always been fascinated by
    how it can be used to solve real-world problems. Through my studies and
    projects, I aim to contribute to the field of AI and make a positive impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about the
    latest advancements in AI, and working on personal projects to apply what
    I've learned. I am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges
    that help me grow both personally and professionally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects and how to
    get in touch with me. Thank you for visiting!
